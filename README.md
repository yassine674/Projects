## 🔐 Cybersecurity — Upcoming Projects
I am actively developing several cybersecurity-focused projects that combine system security, ethical hacking techniques, and automation.  
These include:

- **Network traffic analysis** using packet inspection and anomaly scoring  
- **Attack detection & prevention workflows** for securing system architectures  
- **Automated security scripts** for monitoring, auditing, and hardening environments  
- **Practical cybersecurity labs** exploring real attack vectors and defense mechanisms  

These projects are currently under construction and will be added soon.  
They reflect my commitment to building **real, applicable cybersecurity skills** aligned with professional engineering standards.
