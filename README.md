## 🔐 Cybersecurity — Upcoming Projects

I am currently developing several small but practical cybersecurity exercises that help me strengthen my fundamentals and prepare for more advanced work.

These projects include:
- Basic **network scanning & enumeration** using Nmap  
- Small **Linux security configurations** (users, permissions, SSH hardening)  
- Hands-on **Bash/Python scripts** used for monitoring and automation  
- Beginner-friendly **CTF challenges** to practice problem-solving and real attack scenarios  

They are not fully structured into repositories yet, but they reflect my commitment to improving step-by-step and building solid cybersecurity skills through real practice.

More complete cybersecurity projects will be added soon as I continue progressing.
